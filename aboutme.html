  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Samuel Bakyta and I am a student of the Multimedia Department at the Piarist Unified School in Prievidza.
    I enjoy working with graphics, video, photography and digital content.
    I like trying new things, learning to work with different programs and technologies that help me
    develop my creativity.
    In my free time, I play hockey, play games and make music.
    My goal is to improve in what I do and create content that will entertain and inspire people.
